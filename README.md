# Bikesharing

## Overview

Conducting an analysis on bike trip data during the month of August 2019 to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. 

For the analysis I will use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. 
Creating a set of visualizations to:

* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week

## Summary
The analysis shows that bikes were mostly checked out by male subscribers. Also, bikes were checked out usually between the hours of 8-9am and 5-7pm. This consisted of an average trip time around 5-6 minutes. The busiest days were Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. I would suggest to create a visualization for the age and tripduraton. A visualization for the stations (start and end) with tripdration to see distance among trips could be useful as well.
